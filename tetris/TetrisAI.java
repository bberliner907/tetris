/**
 *  PURPOSE: This class defines the AI tetris player.  You cannot compete
 *  against the machine as of yet, only watch.
 * 
 *  NOTES: Due to lack of time, this AI is incredibly dumb: in fact, it makes
 *  all of its moves randomly with no strategy whatsoever.  A good tetris AI
 *  might instead evaluate the lines + score it could obtain by dropping the
 *  current piece in each location on the board, repeating this query under
 *  each available rotation.  It could then choose its best option accordingly.
